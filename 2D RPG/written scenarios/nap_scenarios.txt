//----DREAMS----//

-Very crucial moments for Mabel (will be 4 in the game after one of the 4 *McGuffins* are found)
-Yumme Niki & Magicant-like dreams that connect with the ones of pastlives or symbolize the adventure so far
-Mabel has only partially seen the ones of pastlives right after her grandmother died
-The "Ones of Pastlives" can be most often seen after a loved one has died


-Dreamlike scenarios (could have a weird sprite of Mabel for these sections, maybe made of clay or 3D model?)
-Walk through various environments and talk to random dream figures 
-NO ITEMS!!!!! ITEMS CANT COME FROM THE DREAM WORLD TO REAL WORLD!!!
-Abilities or powers can awaken within dreams though

-other trails lead to wacky things and such (like magicant)
-other areas can be barren and odd with things that teleport you (like yumme nikki)
-creepy areas to represent nightmares
-nice areas to represent nice dreams



//----NAP 1----//
-wake up in open green field
-white dandelions fly through the blue sky
-trail to the alter in which you can find the ones of pastlives (similar to the star shrine thing from Paper Mario 64 but with a cliff viewing the water)
-paths lead to random enemies you've knocked out and such
-teleportation pads
-telepad 1: black room, ominous music, bright colored creatures speaking nothing but gibberish, friendly creatures though
-telepad 2: green field with odd houses full of lil globby villagers
-telepad 3: infinite lab with scary looking scientist that chases you (if caught brings you to the first room where telepad 3 is)
-a telepad in the infinite lab brings you to the ones of pastlives

-You sit down, close your eyes.
-You see Emmet

-Mabel: "...Emmet?!"

-He looks like his normal self

-Emmet: "Hi, Mabel."
-Emmet: "Would you like to come sit with me?"

-Mabel: "Sure."

-You sit with him by the cliff, like when they were kids

-Mabel: "Emmet... I miss when everything was like this..." "The salty air by the cliffside was so refreshing..."
-Mabel: "I can't believe that was only nine years ago... Feels like a million if you ask me."
-Mabel "Speaking of nine years ago..."
-Mabel: "I'll never forget when we used to watch funny videos on the computer till sunrise."

-Emmet: "Or when we used to run for our lives to catch the ice cream truck."

*pure lighthearted laughs (pure version of emmet's laugh and first time we hear Mabel's laugh)*

-Mabel: "How did we eat all of that ice cream?!"

-Emmet: "We used to eat so much sugar back then!" "Doing that now just makes me wanna puke..."

-Mabel: "I wish I could be here forever, Emmet, I..."
-Mabel: "I also want to tell you that I'm sorry for everything that pushed you down such a road..."
-Mabel: "You went through a bumpy patch and I bet you never expected this to happen to yourself."
-Mabel: "The relentless family arguments that led to countless holes in the wall, Dad pushing you so hard to become a scientist, stealing my video games from the house and selling them for money."
-Mabel: "You may feel like I have pent up anger that I want to unleash on you."
-Mabel: "But I want you to know that I don't feel like that at all."
-Mabel: "I... I just want you to know that through everything that's happened, I still love you."
-Mabel: "You will always be my big bro."

-Emmet: "Mabel... I... I don't know what to-"

-Mabel: "I also forgot to tell you, Mom and Dad talk nonstop about you."

-Emmet: "They do??"

-Mabel: "They love you Emmet. They love you with all of their heart."
-Mabel: "Sometimes I come home to Maria sobbing because you've been gone for so long."
-Mabel: "Mom and Dad are always looking forward to the mail, hoping for one of your letters."

-Emmet: "I..."

-All you can hear is Emmet sobbing uncontrollably on your shoulder. 
-You feel your clothes getting soaked with his tears.

-Mabel: "It's okay, Emmie... It's okay..."

-Emmet: "All I've done is cause inconvienece for others and be a huge screw up."
-Emmet: "The insane lengths I go for anything that matters to me... I can't believe what a disgusting beast I became..."

-Mabel: "Emmet, your devotion is something I've always looked up to." 
-Mabel: "Ever since I could remember all I wanted was to be just like you."
-Mabel: "You aren't a screw up. Your heart was just in the wrong place."

-Emmet: "Mabel... When you finish your adventure... Make sure to tell everyone how much I love them.
-Emmet: "Tell them that we'll see each other again one day. It may not be very soon, but we will be together again."
-Emmet: "Like how we used to be..."

Mabel: "I promise, Emmet."

-Everything gets kinda blurry

Mabel: "What's happening??"

Emmet: "Mabel... Don't take this the wrong way but..." "I can't wait for you to enjoy this."

*bright light eminates the room and then transitions back to the real world*
You wake up.
