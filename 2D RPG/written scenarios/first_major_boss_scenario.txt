//-----Initial Encounter-----//
Mabel: Emmet... This is where you've been the entire time? 
Mabel: I can't believe it's been almost 7 years since I've seen you and 
       this is what you've been doing...
Mabel: What would Mom and Pop think of this?

Emmet: Mom and Pop? Who cares what they would think. They wouldn't understand.
Emmet: Without my help I wouldn't of been able to help countless people who were
       dealt a bad hand. 
Emmet: A hand that has no chance in surviving anywhere in this world. 
Emmet: Taking a jab at the big shots with endless cash isn't going to put a dent
       in their wallets. It doesn't matter how much we take from them.
Emmet: An unfair world such as this needs someone like me. 
Emmet: Someone who can help these poor souls live good lives.

Cat: Help?? I've seen the damage you've done! Those families and local shops your
     goons have threatened and stolen from. 
Cat: All of your help has been nothing but a looming threat to the city. 

Mabel: Please, Emmet. 
Mabel: This isn't the brother I grew up with...
Mabel: This isn't the brother I looked up to...
Mabel: Come home, Emmet. 
Mabel: We could all be together before my day comes. 
Mabel: Mom and Pop would be so happy to see you... 

Emmet: Heh... 
Emmet: Mabel...
Emmet: I'm sorry...
Emmet: But I am important to these people.
Emmet: They need me. 
Emmet: As their leader I must stay and do what I must. 

Mabel: I can't let you do that, Emmet. 
Mabel: This gang of yours...
Mabel: This can't go on any longer...
Mabel: Harrasing the *McGuffin*'s power like this isn't right.
Mabel: It needs to return to where it once belonged.

Emmet: THE *McGuffin* GOES NOWHERE!!
Emmet: MABEL.
Emmet: Even if we are brother and sister, I will defend myself and my people for what's right. 
Emmet: I. WILL. NOT. HAVE. THIS. POWER. TAKEN FROM ME!

Mabel: Then...
Mabel: You leave us no choice but to take it from you.

//----------------First Phase Ends (within battle room)----------------------//
Emmet: *huff* *huff* *wheeze*
Emmet: Fellas! I have an idea! Kill the lights!
*light turns off*

Emmet: Hehehehe...
Emmet: This reminds me of when we were kids.
Emmet: I would enter your room while you were sleeping and turn off your night light.
Emmet: Remember?
Emmet: You would wake up in fear thinking it was a monster. 
Emmet: I remember scaring you so hard you slept in Mom and Pop's room for weeks. 

Cat: Emmet! This is ridiculous! Show yourself!
 
Mabel: Emmet! Please! Enough of the childish games!
Mabel: Enough of the fighting! 
Mabel: Please... I can't hurt you anymore...
Mabel: I can't stand seeing each other like this...
Mabel: Emmie...
Mabel: I just want to go home with you and be with Mom, Pop, and Maria.
Mabel: That's all I want before I go.
Mabel: We could all be together again...
Mabel: You know I will live no longer in less than a month...
Mabel: Have a heart and leave all of this behind...

Emmet: Heheheheh...
Emmet: HAHAHAHAHA!
Emmet: HAVE A HEART???
Emmet: HAVE A HEART?!?!
Emmet: How could I have a heart and leave it all behind..?

*lights flicker back on showing Emmet's second phase form*

Emmet: W H E N  I  D O N T  H A V E  O N E

*maniacal robotic laugh*

(out of battle)

Mabel: Emmet... My own brother...
Mabel: He's gone...

Cat: Mabel...
Cat: That wasn't your brother anymore...
Cat: The *McGuffin*'s power had created a monster...
Cat: If you want we can just go home... 
Cat: Seeing what happened, I don't know how you would keep going.

Mabel: No.
Mabel: I have to see if the *Diety* is real or not.
Mabel: I need to figure out why I'm destined to live no longer in such short time.
Mabel: We already have one of the four *McGuffin*s.
Mabel: And if it were to get into bad hands again...
Mabel: I can't imagine what terrors it could bring upon. 
Mabel: Let's just get some sleep somewhere...
